    A string is considered a palindrome if it remains unchanged when reversed. For example, "dad" is a palindrome as reverse of
    "dad" is "dad", whereas "program" is not a palindrome. Note: palindromes are case insensitive ("Dad" and "dad" are both palindromes). */

    other element in the list. Thus, if the list has 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', the output should be "bd". */

     than 20. The function returns the result of the operations on the array. */


    /* Write a function that takes in a list of names, filters the list removing all duplicate names and returns a list with unique names. */



    /* Write a function that takes in a string, omits all vowels and returns a new string that contains only consonants. Make sure
     to catch the edge cases (e.g. empty string, upper/lower case). */


    /* Write in a function that takes in a positive integer, creates a linked list with integers in the range from 1 to the input
     number and returns a middle element of the linked list if the length of the linked list is an odd number, otherwise -1. */

     asks the user to type in a family member's name and returns his/her age if the name exists or the string "Such family member
     does not exist!" if such a member does not exit. */
